# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
# library(tarchetypes) # Load other packages as needed.

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(

    "glmnet",
    "bonsai",
    "lightgbm"

  format = "qs",
  # set memory to transient
  memory = "transient",
  repository = "local"
)

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
suppressWarnings({tar_source("src")})
# tar_source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed.

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(
  # data
